# Mouse Mayhem Game

Game developed by Andrew Stanton and Brandon Young

# Gameplay Objective / Idea

Help the mouse family escape the evil cat "**Cuddles**".
Guide the mice family around obstacles to not allow Cuddles to get the mice family.
If Cuddles gets close you will lose your mice family one by one. Slowly getting eaten.
However if you still have your mouse `wife` you can have new baby children to replace your slow dead kids.

# What Makes This Difficult?

The game will get faster and more intense. Perhaps putting harder obstacles to overcome
Maybe there will be `faulty` pickups which cause the screen to warp or something to make it difficult.
